## READ 

TIP: The further you scroll down the weirder the tokens get

The Wordlist contains potential glitch tokens, keep in mind that there will to 100% tokens dont cause any failure since some are just normal words and its hard to filter them out without maybe filterting out a glitch token too. 

## What are Glitch Tokens?

Glitch tokens are anomalous strings in an LLM’s vocabulary like "SolidGoldMagikarp" that trigger erratic or nonsensical responses. They exist because of a "mismatch" between the tokenizer and the model training. If a tokenizer identifies a string (often from niche Reddit usernames or code) that was rarely used during the model’s actual training, the LLM lacks a meaningful representation for it. These tokens cause the model to hallucinate or fail.
